"Towards Climate-Neutral and Socially Innovative Cities","This purpose of this topic is to develop a one-stop shop platform providing the necessary technical, regulatory, financial and socio-economic expertise as well as assistance to cities for developing and implementing their climate action plans, and related social innovation action plans. The project can involve research organisations, academia, industry including social entrepreneurs, the financial sector including impact financiers, investors, philanthropists, NGOs, national and local authorities and citizens. The project should also be responsible for the management of competitive calls addressed to third parties to fulfil the objectives of this action. The platform should facilitate the coordination of ongoing European activities in the area of climate neutrality for cities and should be sustainable, scalable and self-financed beyond the life of the action. Where relevant, the action should take into due account and build on existing platforms[4], experience already matured by the Covenant of Mayors[5] initiative and methodologies, analysis and processes developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission as well as based on the principles and standards of the Join, Boost, Sustain Declaration[6].","2020-09-22","2021-01-26","17:00:00","false","Horizon 2020","European Union","EU+Associated countries","LC-GD-1-2-2020","6.

Particular attention should be paid to citizens’ engagement, social innovation and social entrepreneurship, environmental, economic and health benefits, and Just Transition mechanisms.\nSupport cities in innovating their local governance and, where appropriate, building capacity to implement systemic and integrated climate-neutral policies, also building on existing experiences developed by local networks[11];\nCoordinate the group of cities committing to the climate-neutral city contract, ensuring an operational customer-driven link of this action with the cities as final users. Facilitating the sharing of experience and good practices and mutual learning between cities regarding setting up and mainstreaming co-creation processes engaging all relevant actors for the framing, deployment and assessment of their vision, strategy, and an action plan to reach climate neutrality while ensuring shared ownership.\nActivity 2: Investment project preparation and finance:\n\nProvide information and consulting services to cities on preparing and financing investment projects for the transition to climate neutrality. This should take into account and build on the good practices developed by global, European and national initiatives and programmes such as Horizon 2020, ELTIS, ELENA, CIVITAS, EIP on Smart Cities and Communities (EIP-SCC) Marketplace, EIT Climate KIC, Intelligent Cities Challenge (ICC), European City Facility, JPI Urban Europe, Positive Energy Districts, Green City Accord, the European Green Capital award. Financial solutions should include, but should not be restricted to, those provided by InvestEU, EIB, EBRD and the European Structural and Investment Fund. Collaboration with national development banks as well as commercial banks is also encouraged.\nActivity 3: Social innovation and citizens’ engagement:\n\nSupport cities and local communities in testing solutions (including new technologies, non-technological, and social innovations) that stem from European R&I. This should entail a matching of cities’ and local communities’ needs to R&I results through various means, e.g., match-making and brokerage hubs;\nCombine existing results of European R&I with social innovation, and take advantage of the digital transformation and digital infrastructure to co-create and test solutions with local communities, including changes in social practices and behaviour;\nProvide support to cities for reinforcing not only communication but also citizens’ engagement activities involving also marginalised or vulnerable to exclusion citizens. This should include sharing and using good practices on social innovation as well as enabling cities and local communities to exchange experiences and learn from each other when testing and implementing solutions, connecting more innovators and researchers and making them aware of citizens’ needs, and, though all these channels, helping cities move closer to climate neutrality.\nActivity 4: Research and Innovation for climate-neutral transformation of cities:\n\nOnce the services of the platform are made available, open calls for proposals will be launched to support large scale pilots for the deployment in lead cities or districts of systemic solutions combining, as appropriate, technological, nature-based, social, cultural, regulatory and financial innovation and new business and governance models to underpin the climate transition, taking stock of existing best practises and already available solutions. These calls should be evaluated by external, independent experts in a fair and transparent process.\nIn order to facilitate the upscaling of these solutions and their replicability, the pilots will also support for each lead city and/or district, activities dedicated to the twinning with and mentoring of at least 2 other cities and/or districts from different EU Member States or H2020 associated countries facing structural disadvantages or with a size smaller than 50 000 inhabitants, which are willing to develop their proper climate action plan and implement it in a subsequent phase beyond the life of the current action.","Contribution to achieving climate neutrality by 2030 in the participating leading cities and districts due to the development and deployment of a comprehensive methodology, including selecting criteria, and model covering cross-sectoral governance, citizens participations, social innovation and social entrepreneurship impact, financing and policy approaches, and an urban digital platform;\nSystemic transformation of cities towards climate neutrality, via support from a European level structure;\nCrossing of social tipping points and implementation of the Green Deal, through social innovation that empowers cities and local communities;\nLeading the transition to climate neutrality by mobilising the demand (citizens’ needs) and showcasing testing of innovative solutions drawing from European R&I through a socially inclusive mechanism;\nEuropean cities moving towards climate neutrality by 2030 through measures that demonstrate visible substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution as part of an agreed pathway to climate neutrality by 2050 or earlier;\nImproved share of sustainable and active transport modes. Reduced negative externalities of urban and peri-urban transportation: congestion, pollution and road collisions. Enhanced multimodality and facilitated use of sustainable and clean modes of transport.","The strategic long-term vision[1] published by the Commission for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate-neutral economy calls for a drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\nThe European Commission’s Green Deal[2] proposes a new growth strategy that aims to preserve the planet for future generations. It should serve as the compass to emerge from the present COVID-19 crisis and offers the opportunity to bounce forward and accelerate our progress towards meeting the EU climate change objectives. It sets an ambitious target of a 50%-55% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Through its roadmap for action it outlines a long-term vision for the environment, involving all sectors of the economy, geared towards reaching the goal of climate neutrality.\n\nWhile cities occupy only 2% of the planet’s landmass, they consume over 65% of the world’s energy and account for more than 70% of global man-made CO2 emissions. Currently 75% of European citizens live in cities and this percentage is expected to rise to 80% by 2050. Therefore, cities[3] must play a crucial role in helping Europe reach the targets of the Green Deal. The Commission will support their systemic transformation towards climate neutrality leveraging, in particular, technological, non-technological and social innovation and new AI-based solutions.\n\nThe challenge resides with achieving significant progress towards climate neutrality at a large (European) scale by fostering climate-neutrality and social innovation in cities. This means capitalising on existing research and innovation, valorising available knowledge in Europe, and using Green Deal-targeted social, financial, and technological innovation to co-create, test, and deploy systemic, integrated solutions, technologies, and incentive schemes with cities to tackle the largest sources of pollution in urban and metropolitan areas. It also implies designing incentives promoting investments such as green infrastructure into cities committed to climate neutrality and the Green Deal objectives. This will help test innovative solutions, technologies, and incentives to reach the scale that will make them attractive for industry economically, for citizens in terms of affordability, liveability, and inclusiveness, and for local authorities as concern effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of life. Testing these solutions and incentives will require listening to the needs of citizens and engaging cities to act. Framing the above-mentioned elements necessitates taking into account the consequences and long-lasting impacts on cities of the current health and economic crisis, affecting for example mobility, transportation, urban planning, digitisation, provision of services, etc. It requires triggering and supporting lasting changes in social, business, and administrative practices and in individual behaviours with clear impacts on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution and other co-benefits that citizens, businesses and public authorities find desirable."," ","","53,000,000.00","more than 10 millions","Collective","false","","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-1-2-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=;typeCodes=1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502;programCode=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=Default;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState"

Activities should involve relevant international, national and EU agencies (e.g. European Environment Agency (EEA), European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), …) and end-users (such as forest owners, forest-based industry actors, environmental and nature management organisations, firefighters, local and regional authorities, etc) from Member States and Associated Countries. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation, multilateral international cooperation is encouraged. The topic will be implemented through two distinct sub-topics. Proposals should address only one of the following subtopics:\nSubtopic 1 (Innovation Actions): Actions funded under this call will speed up the pan-European adaptation process to extreme wildfires by advancing and applying research and innovation, including demonstration pilot sites, while making best use of existing data (e.g. remote sensing, in-situ or community-based data), technologies (e.g. Big Data and Artificial Intelligence) and services (as Copernicus, Galileo and EGNOS).\n\nInnovative means and methods should be developed, integrated and demonstrated in different environments across Europe (including EU Outermost regions) and tailored to geographical and socio-economic conditions, with different types of fuels (e.g. forest/bush /peat fire threats), landscapes and biodiversity values (e.g. coastal/alpine/agriculture/rural/Wild-Urban Interface/islands) and scales (e.g. local/regional /national/cross-border/EU/international).\n\nThe approach should be systemic: encompassing different climate scenarios, biogeographical/socio-economic contexts, traditional practices and new means for faster and smarter management of all interconnected fire management phases, i.e. prevention and preparedness (including forecasting and landscape management for impact mitigation, adapting tree species composition and forest management practices), detection and response (including fire containment, extinction, potential evacuation and recovery) and post-fire restoration[5] and adaptation to climate change.\n\nProposals should consider an Integrated Fire Management strategy[6] to include viewpoints from all parties in a participative way. They should cover all of the fire management phases (i.e. prevention and preparedness, detection and response, restoration and adaptation), while focusing within each phase on a subset of activities, as described below:\n\nPhase A - Prevention and Preparedness\n\nThe integration of environmental, climate and socio-economic conditions (including tangible and intangible cultural heritage) with proactive governance (public and private actors), community-based risk awareness, prevention and preparedness activities may include among others:\n\nsupporting the integration of socioeconomic and environmental information on wildfire causes and impacts into existing EU databases (e.g. EFFIS) with a focus on extreme wildfire events, the causes of wildfire ignitions (e.g., accidental, criminal and natural causes) and the demographic dynamics and trends (e.g. rural abandonment and other land use change activities);\nimproving fire and landscape management of both public and private lands (including forest, agricultural and agro-forest lands using both traditional and innovative approaches for sustainable fuel management, improved forest management practices (i.e. enhanced diversity of forest tree species and forest structure, thinning, agroforestry, etc), including community-based incentive programmes for biomass monitoring and reduction, land requalification, and new bioeconomy value chains that maximise wood and non-wood forest products and services whilst improving biodiversity and resilience;\nenhancing access to official fire danger index rating and warnings in cooperation with existing EU initiatives (e.g. Copernicus services, EFFIS, with resolution tailored to the conditions), through upscaling the use of mobile apps, digital infrastructure and advanced cyber technologies;\nbuilding a common culture on risk prevention and preparedness across Europe, including behavioural change of citizens, local authorities, businesses and schools, through education and training, community involvement and awareness campaigns to encourage self-protection, safety and environmental protection (through spatial planning), with special attention to Wildland Urban Interface areas;\nintegrating fire safety knowledge and engineering to support the design, construction, and management of fire-resilient buildings and infrastructures;\nsupporting the integration of wildfire prevention and resilience into governance and insurance models, including alternative risk transfer solutions and products, and accounting for risks due to cascading effects on society at large and critical infrastructures in particular;\nimprove early-warning tools by integrating forest stand bio-geographical data (i.e. tree species composition, soil traits, tree age composition, etc) in forecasting models;\nimproving the understanding of the link between the exposure to smoke and air pollutants from fires and health and well-being in local communities and first responders;\ndeveloping Broad Earth System studies for weather and climate drivers as well as biophysical feedback of global forest fires on climate to improve existing wildfire information systems from national to global scales[7]- leading to new operational seasonal (coarse) and short-term (high-resolution) forecasts, using climate-vegetation-fires models but also historical wildfires records and paleoclimate evidence.\nPhase B - Detection and Response\n\nAnticipation and mitigation of high-impact events will benefit from research and innovation in space, aerial, ground, material and digital technologies, which should be integrated altogether with environmental, climate and social disciplines and existing EU initiatives on monitoring and suppression of wildfires. Activities should be demonstrated in a broad range of weather conditions and geographical scenarios. Activities may include among others:\n\nmeasures to stimulate investments from private sector in new technologies for retrofitting and/or developing new detection & response technologies;\nfast-track research and innovation in space and aerial means (e.g. satellites, pseudo-satellites, aircraft including drones, remote sensing systems) for detection, targeting and extinction of fires, such as better water-bomber helicopters / planes able to operate safely at night; modular firefighting units fit for cargo/multi-mission aircraft; improved scooping, tanking and discharging;\nimproving firefighters’ and manned & unmanned ground/air vehicles’ location, route management, patrolling and automation in real time - including via (EU) aerial/satellite navigation/observation/communication services - to guide and protect fire brigades and vehicles operating simultaneously to respond efficiently to fires in all conditions;\ndeveloping near real-time high-fidelity fire and smoke propagation forecasting, based on precise topography, weather, fuel and combustion modelling, via aero-space data and services, advance sensing (e.g. temperatures, winds), machine-learning and supercomputing;\nenhancing interoperable and secure incident-management, decision-making and communication, coordination and command systems, able to incorporate information from multiple platforms (manned and unmanned) and non-traditional sources (as social media), particularly in non-urban environments and across European countries e.g. air-to-air, ground-to-ground and air-to-ground, exploiting satellite and ad-hoc communication links for near real-time transmissions;\ndeveloping strategies, procedures and tools for incident management teams to interact with citizens at risk and spread appropriate warnings, evacuation or confinement messages in consideration of human factors filters and psychological dimension, with the use of a broad range of means (including social media…) so that the entire targeted population can be efficiently reached;\nenabling better integration of wireless sensors, early warning systems, fire retardant rapid deployment, search & rescue and evacuation of persons and animals (e.g., contingency plans) and better connection with other sectors that also monitor forest data, such as Distribution System Operators tracking aerial power lines;\ndeveloping advanced personal monitoring and protective equipment for emergency responders (e.g., smart garments, gear and breathing apparatus) tailored for wildfire conditions, assisted with advanced ICT decision support systems, land/air robotics and improved fire retardants/extinguishing agents;\ndeveloping better training, including virtual reality simulators for air fleet and ground resources;\nenabling better and faster estimates of the impact of fire events on direct losses, including the number of people affected, interruption or damage to critical infrastructure networks, direct economic losses, dispersion of hazards and contaminants dispersion, impact on water sources and other cascading effects.\nPhase C - Restoration and Adaptation\n\nProposals should aim at supporting the socio-ecological transition towards more resilient communities, in particular those most exposed to wildfire risk. Activities may include among others:\n\nevaluating and upscaling the deployment of ecosystem-based restoration solutions across various biogeographical contexts, building on the solutions developed by EU-funded demonstration projects on nature-based solutions (NBS);\nadvancing and demonstrating systemic and structural measures for fuel treatments and tree/forest management aiming at resilient wildland-urban interfaces, taking into account the relevant spatial scales and fire ecology principles in relation to climate change;\ndemonstrating sustainable post-fire ecosystem restoration solutions of damaged ecosystems aiming at restoring biodiversity, including local soil microbiota for ecosystem resilience and supported by monitoring services and complementary geospatial analysis;\ncontributing to the definition of a common EU legal framework for the governance systems and operational activities regarding forest and communities protection from climate-related risks;\ntesting and developing public-private cooperation mechanisms to leverage investments from the private sector, including insurance companies in order to stimulate the development of preventive measures and reduce losses from wildfires;\nsupporting mechanisms and promotion of governance systems for restoration and adaptation through the involvement, coordination, and cooperation of different actors and sectors bridging between national and local administrative levels.\nThe Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 15 to 20 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

It also calls “to boost the EU’s ability to predict and manage environmental disasters” as an immediate priority. Large-scale and more intense wildfires are becoming an increasing concern. Fire is a natural component in many ecosystems across Europe but more and more Europeans suffer directly and indirectly from wildfires. Between 2017 and 2020, fires have killed hundreds of persons and ravaged forests and Natura 2000 sites not only in Southern Europe, but increasingly also in Central, Eastern and Northern Europe.\n\nIn addition to the extraordinary socioeconomic impact in terms of loss of human lives of residents and first responders, health, infrastructures and economic activity, extreme wildfire events have also serious and sometimes irreversible ecological impacts when considering soil degradation, water scarcity and biodiversity loss.\n\nMoreover, wildfires are among the first contributors to climate change, with up to 20% of total global greenhouse gas emissions per year[1]. Furthermore, the large surfaces burnt cannot absorb so much CO2 any longer, reducing the climate change mitigation potential of carbon sinks. Extreme wildfires are now observed more frequently in higher altitudes and latitudes and further contribute to accelerating climate change by increased black carbon fall-out on ice/snow and by melting of underlying permafrost.\n\nIn addition, large wildfires degrade air quality through the direct emissions of toxic pollutants affecting first responders and local residents, while populations in regions far away from the wildfires can be exposed to other pollutants as the air is transported, with short- and long-term impact on human health.\n\nClimate change, certain forestry practices, ecosystem degradation and rural depopulation increase the depth and breadth of wildfires in the EU. Climate change is predicted to increase fire risk, with longer fire seasons, more frequent fire events, new fire-prone regions and more severe fire behaviour. The burnt area in southern Europe during the 21st century would sharply increase. The number of people living near wildland and exposed to high-to-extreme fire danger levels for at least 10 days per year would grow by 15 million with 3°C warming, compared to now[2]. Furthermore, global warming could result in a substantial shift northwards of European ecological domains, making the recovery or re-establishment of non-adapted ecosystems more difficult after a fire. Extreme wildfire events as in Southern Europe in 2017-2018 and in California, Brazil and Australia in 2019, are likely to become common throughout the whole of Europe.","","","72,000,000.00","more than 10 millions","Collective","","","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-1-1-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=;typeCodes=1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCode=H2020;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=H2020-LC-GD-2020;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=callTopicSearchTableState"

The failure of economic, financial and industrial policies to sufficiently mitigate and adapt to climate change is more than ever a primary concern for societies worldwide[1]. Europe’s commitment to accelerate efforts regarding climate change adaptation and to reach climate neutrality and resilience by 2050 is emphasised in the European Green Deal and will be further supported by the European economic recovery plan from the COVID-19 pandemic. In some regions and communities, incremental adaptation will not be sufficient to mitigate the impacts of climate change on socio-ecological systems[2]. They need radical and transformative ways of reducing climate vulnerability and building resilience. Some solutions for regional adaptation have been developed and successfully tested at small scale, ranging from innovative technologies to nature-based solutions, new business models, as well as governance and social innovations. Now, the challenge is to scale up and demonstrate at large scale systemic solutions to trigger behavioural change and new ways of decision-making, while accounting for local and regional contexts. Multidisciplinary approaches that integrate technological, digital, business, governance, environmental dimensions with social innovation are needed for the development of adaptation pathways consistent with European Green Deal targets, and tailored to support the regions and communities most exposed to climate change impacts.","","","43,000,000.00","more than 10 millions","","","","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-1-3-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=;typeCodes=1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCode=H2020;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=H2020-LC-GD-2020;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=callTopicSearchTableState"
"European capacities for citizen deliberation and participation for the Green Deal","All areas of the European Green Deal, from climate action to zero pollution, require citizens’ active support at all stages of the transitions. Workable solutions, accepted and taken-up at scale, can only be found through the active participation of all concerned. This is particularly the case of complex issues with diverging views or interests at stake, such as the rural-urban gap, attitudes to the bio-economy, water management, the choice of energy sources, etc. Such issues can best be addressed through participatory processes involving citizens from different cross-sections of society across Europe, including by engaging them throughout the innovation life cycle[1] as social innovators. The Conference on the Future of Europe has further heightened awareness of the need for participatory processes and raised expectations in this respect. Strong expectations of citizen participation have also been raised in the context of Horizon Europe preparation, in particular for Horizon Europe Missions, which will be highly relevant to the European Green Deal.\n\nSuch processes may include a large spectrum of co-creation activities and events based on dialogue and information exchange, including but not limited to virtual ones. Modalities of participatory processes differ according to goals and expected outcomes, from harnessing diversity of knowledge, expectations and views in order to improve knowledge quality and enrich the inputs to policy discussions; up to creating ‘mini-publics’ in order to extend the arenas of public discussion and improve the representativeness of policy decisions. For these processes to be effective, participants should be equipped with appropriate tools and information, they should be strongly connected to decision-making bodies – examples span from simple feedback mechanisms to participatory budgeting – and they should be empowered to reflect, deliberate and propose change at a systemic level.\n\nParticipatory processes in general and citizen deliberation in particular, require different levels of expertise, as well as upfront clarification of ethical and methodological principles and a clear commitment on the side of institutions about the processes’ outcomes.

Actions should establish transnational and transdisciplinary networks of experts, researchers, practitioners and relevant civil society organisations on behavioural, social and cultural change. They should jointly analyse social practices and behavioural change processes, including enabling as well as inhibiting factors, share good practice, tools and resources and implement relevant experimentation on priority issues to deliver on the European Green Deal. They should build on existing experience, notably stemming from EU-funded projects.\n\nActions should include several experimental studies, each implemented in at least four Member States and/or Associated Countries. Specific topics for case studies should be co-decided with the European Commission services involved in implementing the European Green Deal. They should support major EU actions where such change is key, including – but not limited to – Horizon Europe Missions, in close cooperation with the respective mission boards, and other R&I initiatives.\n\nVulnerable and marginalised people, minorities and various age groups, including both youth and the older generation, as well as various skill and income groups and urban, peri-urban and rural areas, should be considered in analysis and included in experimentation, with methods and tools adapted to the target groups.

National and local governments and administrations should be associated from an early stage, including, to the extent possible, links with similar initiatives at these levels and with their policy and regulatory actions. Actions should also build on bottom-up initiatives stemming from groups of citizens, notably from the younger generation, as well as from various communities and organisations, including social partners and for example those active in the social economy, and seek to expand the agency of individual people and communities.\n\nActions should design methodologies for each individual exercise, relying on comparative analysis of international best practice, including comprehensive impact evaluation and involving the people or groups concerned. Depending on their specific objectives, they may either ensure consistency across Member States/Associated Countries for transnational comparability, or select a range of different methodologies to compare their effectiveness.\n\nAll relevant factors of behaviour change should be considered. Actions should therefore propose a transdisciplinary approach to behavioural change, looking at system dynamics and integrating historical, cultural, societal, economic and psychological perspectives, as well as gender studies and intersectional research. For example, disciplines such as anthropology, cultural psychology, cultural studies, semiotics and sociology can shed light on cultural change as one of the crucial preconditions of behavioural change, whereas engaging social and economic psychology may help to establish a more nuanced concept of human behaviour itself. Inequalities related to climate change and the socio-ecological transition should also be considered, as well as the role of science communication, journalism and the media.\n\nBroader institutional (legal, financial, economic) conditions that enable and facilitate behavioural change should be considered and should lead to policy and regulatory recommendations. Actions should address the feedback loops between behavioural change and the evolution of the broader context, including with regard to socio-economic resilience and stability. They should also consider the full impact of behavioural change, including trade-offs, side and rebound effects.\n\nAn advisory board should ensure the scientific soundness, ethical and unbiased character of the planned experiments and vet the methodologies and conditions of implementation of each individual exercise.\n\nActions should also study each individual exercise, assess and compare their results across the Member States/Associated Countries and provide feedback and recommendations.\n\nProposals should dedicate resources to engage in coordination and cooperation with the other projects funded under this topic and others of this area, since behavioural, social and cultural change are often directly linked with deliberation, engagement and activism.

These changes concern, for example, mobility behaviour, minimising traffic-related emissions and energy/resource consumption, protecting or restoring biodiversity, etc. including changes achieved through collective and participatory processes or a sense of environmental citizenship and climate justice.\n\nSeveral foci of behaviour and mind-set are at play in interconnected ways: concerns for: personal health and well-being; for the planet; for decent work; for fairness and solidarity, etc. Ways of combining individual, collective socio-economic and environmental benefits should be sought wherever possible.\n\nDisadvantaged and vulnerable social groups and groups and communities most affected by the transition need special attention. Their existing practices, for example, may combine environmentally friendly, circular habits with practices that are detrimental to both their own health and to the environment (from dietary choices, mobility and travel behaviour to inappropriate use, reuse and disposing of materials), but to which they see no feasible alternatives. Similarly, differences of perception (in different regions of the EU, among different social groups, across genders and various age groups) of the urgency of the climate change and other environmental issues, on the most appropriate measures needed and hence also on the urgency of related behaviour change, need focused attention. Other categories of actors have to face challenging dilemmas, such as economic agents bearing major additional costs, adaptations or even phasing out of their activities due to Green Deal requirements. In such cases, individual change should be addressed in the context of the collective benefits and cost-sharing arrangements of the Green Deal and it should be associated to broader structural measures to support affected groups. Addressing these issues requires research and experimentation on behavioural, social and cultural change across Europe, founded on transdisciplinary expertise and strong ethical and methodological standards. Moreover, these actions should be accompanied with comparative research and feedback to ensure continuous monitoring and learning, foresee robust impact evaluation methods and take account of possible trade-offs, unintended consequences or rebound effects.","","","10,000,000.00","more than 1 million","Collective","","","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-10-2-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=;typeCodes=1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCode=H2020;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=H2020-LC-GD-2020;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=callTopicSearchTableState"

Each proposal should also reflect a balanced geographical representation of the demonstration sites covering different regions in Europe.\nThe Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the European Union in the range of EUR 3 to 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.\n\nSubtopic 2: Enabling citizens to act on climate change and for sustainable development through better monitoring and observing of the environment and their environmental impacts\nActions in this subtopic will target the involvement of citizens in climate- and environment-related issues and domains, such as biodiversity, marine and freshwater pollution, water scarcity and sustainable transport and food production. They will focus on the active participation of citizens through citizen science, environmental observation and civic consortia. Projects should be conducted on a broad scale, i.e. in cooperation with businesses, civil society organisations, public authorities and existing initiatives (such as the Climate Adapt platform[14] and the Covenant of Mayors[15]), to ensure that these actions will lead to examples on how to engage the wider community in the effective behavioural changes and changes in social practices needed for a successful and just transition. The key component of this subtopic is to raise awareness, engage and empower citizens and consumers with concrete tools to monitor their impacts on the environment, to collect information enabling them to change their behaviour and to reduce their personal carbon and environmental footprint as user and consumer through individual and social innovation. Actions should include the development and/or improvement of devices (low-cost sensors, consumer apps, such as wearable sensors, a trusted user-friendly app with robust carbon footprint calculations, extreme weather community app, for the purposes of early warning, marine and freshwater litter watch) taking into account the interoperability and exchange of future and existing data collected. Attention should be paid to promoting gender-equal participation and deconstructing gender stereotypes.","Subtopic 1:\na multidisciplinary European competence framework within the context of lifelong learning that will serve as a reference tool for the Member States, the public and private sector, stakeholders, and NGOs to help citizens to become engaged actors in the green transformation of society;\nThe ability to assess the knowledge, skills and attitudes of citizens and in particular young people on climate change, sustainable development and environmental protection;\nspecific educational programmes, school curricula, trainings, networking activities and exchange of good practices in the area of climate change and education for sustainable development;\nenhanced engagement of the wider community, including with the use of digital media, to make the behavioural changes needed for a successful transition by undertaking consultations, testing and implementation of this framework in schools, universities, training institutions, municipalities, public authorities in cooperation with the private sector, teachers, trainers, students, pupils, parents;\nthe large participation of pupils and students, supported by scientists, educators and practitioners, in intergenerational dialogues and exchanges on climate action, environmental protection and behavioural changes for sustainable development;\nthe broad testing, dissemination and use of the European competence framework at concrete demonstration sites (e.g. in schools, universities and identified education communities) and in innovative activities (e.g. incubators for citizen participation, informal youth city councils, use of social media and digital tools…).\nSubtopic 2:\nthe development or strengthening of citizen science initiatives to engage citizens in the active collection of environmental and socio-economic data through individual new or improved devices;\nthe provision of personalized information to citizens and consumers about their environmental impact;\na better monitoring of the environment (land, sea, air, etc.);\nbehavioural change processes on the part of citizens, consumers and communities towards more sustainable patterns in reducing their carbon and environmental footprint, changing their consumption and lifestyle choices to achieve goals of a climate-neutral, sustainable Europe through concrete and targeted advice.\n","The active role of citizens and their direct involvement is essential to address climate change and other human actions harming the environment on land, air and sea. Changes in citizen’s and consumer’s behaviours towards more sustainable patterns can happen through education, awareness raising, citizen science, observation and monitoring of their environmental impacts, civic engagement and social innovation. It is essential to directly involve citizens and communities in contributing to climate action and protecting the environment, thereby encouraging them to change their personal behaviour and their mindsets, reducing their carbon and environmental footprint and taking action at the individual and collective level. This would lead to a more sustainable lifestyle and relationship to the environment.\nA strong emphasis is placed on strengthening environmental awareness of the young generation through education and other forms of youth engagement. Pupils and students have the potential to become ambassadors for climate action, sustainable development and environmental protection by sharing their knowledge, experience and engagement with their families, local communities, public and private decision makers, as well as through communication and the use of social media. As recommended in the European Green Deal Communication[1], schools, training institutions and universities are well positioned to engage with pupils, parents and the wider community on the changes needed for a successful transition to a green economy. A European competence framework is needed to help develop and assess knowledge, skills and attitudes on climate change and sustainable development. Related demonstration activities on for example nature-based solutions, biodiversity conservation, waste management, sustainable energy production and consumption, marine science, etc. will support the testing and the implementation of the framework.\nCitizen science is a powerful tool for climate action, sustainable development and environmental protection through civic engagement. Citizen science should be understood broadly, covering a range of different levels of participation, from raising public knowledge of science, encouraging citizens to participate in the scientific process by observing, gathering and processing data, right up to setting scientific agenda and co-designing and implementing science-related policies. It could also involve publication of results and teaching science. Citizen science activities should be based on a robust scientific methodology ensuring the quality of the data collected and a fair representation of all stakeholders involved. Citizen science will help to raise awareness, to educate in science, to increase understanding of scientific processes and scientific literacy. It will also provide new tools and data for environmental monitoring, covering a broad European geography. Citizen science can strongly contribute to the delivery of environmental data with a significant potential for further broad use, including contributing to improving relevant European policies. It will have real-life impact through adaptations in citizen/consumer personal behaviours.\nInitiatives should be coherent with the objectives of the European Green Deal, the European Climate Pact[2] and the European Biodiversity Strategy for 2030[3] to engage citizens and communities in action addressing climate change, sustainable development and environmental protection. The proposed activities will build on existing initiatives and practices that demonstrate at international, European, national, regional and local level innovation in teaching and learning methods and how to engage the wider community in the changes needed for a successful and just transition. For example, experience can be learned from the European Ocean Literacy platform[4], the European Atlas of the Seas[5], the Plastic Pirates initiative[6], the citizen science platform[7], the Horizon 2020 project TeRRIFICA[8], Scientix[9], School Education Gateway[10], resources for nature-based solutions in education[11], UNESCO experience in Education for Sustainable Development[12], as well as cultural, creative and artistic activities as a tool for empowering citizens.","","","25,000,000.00","more than 1 million","","","","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-10-3-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=;typeCodes=1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCode=H2020;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=H2020-LC-GD-2020;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=callTopicSearchTableState"

Projects should combine at least two or more renewable energy sources and/or two or more renewable energy technologies. The seasonal loads of the DHC or daily/seasonal loads of the CHP system (for example when coupled to an industrial process), and the daily/seasonal availability of the renewable energy sources have to be properly taken into account. Projects should assess the sustainability of the proposed solutions in environmental, social and economic terms.\nFor DHC systems, the integration of sources of otherwise wasted excess heat or cold as well as the interfacing with existing heating or cooling distribution networks can be considered. For CHP solutions, the minimum capacity in terms of power supply should be 2,5 MW and the electrical efficiency is expected to go well beyond the state of the art. The optimization in terms of energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the proposed solutions, as well as the adaptability to existing systems for a representative variety of network conditions in the EU should be addressed. Projects should assess the sustainability of the proposed solutions in environmental, social and economic terms and should also take into account the requirements of the final users.\nProjects should bring the proposed solutions to TRL 4-5.\nIn order to ensure a balanced portfolio, at least the highest ranking proposal addressing CHP and DHC will be funded, provided it attains all thresholds.\nThe Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 6 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.\nSubtopic 2 (Innovation Action): Demonstration of innovative technologies to enable future large scale deployment of offshore renewable energy\nProjects must demonstrate at sea critical offshore renewable energy innovations considering the efficiency, reliability, scalability, sustainability and circularity that is needed in all areas of the offshore renewable energy system, notably:\nOffshore renewable energy power generating systems: innovative integrated offshore (floating) wind, wave, tidal and/or solar systems, on a floating or fixed-bottom substructure, considering the varied subsea and metocean conditions.\nAnd/or\nGrid infrastructure: real life demonstration of innovative Direct Current (DC), AC/DC hybrid technologies and systems as a supporting step towards large offshore DC, AC/DC hybrid grids (e.g. multi-vendor Multi-Terminal HVDC (MT HVDC) systems, grid forming converter, HVDC diode rectifiers, Modular Multilevel Converters (MMC), DC Circuit Breaker (DCCB); DC/DC converter and DC/power hub) and their control and management systems; for floating renewable energy technologies: innovative dynamic inter-device/inter-array cables and connections to converter stations at sea or offshore hubs.\nIn order to ensure a balanced portfolio, at least the highest ranking proposal addressing Offshore renewable energy power generating systems and the highest ranking proposal addressing Grid infrastructure will be funded, provided it attains all thresholds. This condition to ensure a balanced portfolio will also considered to be met if one project addressing both aspects will be funded. Furthermore, projects may also include:\nPower to X /battery/ storage systems: innovative offshore storage, battery and/or power to X systems to maximise the use of offshore resources and increase the system resilience.\nThe innovative demonstration actions might be part of a larger project or already making use of existing infrastructure. Multi-functional platforms can be considered.\nProposals should address also the following:\nIndustrial design and manufacturing processes, circularity of (critical) raw materials, scalability,, installation methods, transport, operation & maintenance, supply chains and the related digital infrastructures.\nRegulatory, market and financial challenges.\nMarine spatial planning issues (making multi-use of the seas possible, but also considering optimising environmental impacts) as well as currently known barriers such as costs, public acceptance and vulnerability to changing climate conditions in offshore areas, and considering needs, values and expectations of society through close and continuous discussion with stakeholders.\nProjects are requested to demonstrate the technologies at sea while respecting existing environmental regulatory framework.\nPresent an environmental monitoring plan to be implemented during the demonstration action.\nThe project consortium should demonstrate how it contributes to knowledge building and innovation. Development of new knowledge, models and solutions are paramount to maximize the benefits of the energy transition, to ensure that the right choices are made, and to optimize technologies and systems.\nThe project has to include a clear go/no go moment ahead of entering the deployment phase. Before this go/no-go moment, the project has to deliver the detailed engineering plans, a complete business and implementation plan and all needed permits for the deployment of the project. The project should clearly demonstrate a proposed pathway to obtaining necessary permits for the demonstration actions and allow for appropriate timelines to achieve these. The project should also demonstrate how it will get a financial close for the whole action. Independent experts will assess all deliverables and will advise for the go/no-go decision.","Subtopic 1: Development of land-based renewable energy technologies and their integration into the energy system\nProjects will bring clear benefits in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, air pollutants emissions and the use of fossil fuels. They will also demonstrate that an affordable, reliable, secure and flexible DHC and/or CHP systems based on onshore, local renewables can be designed to be adaptive and scalable according to the energy demand.\nSubtopic 2: Demonstration of innovative technologies to enable future large scale deployment of offshore renewable energy\nThe project should clearly demonstrate all potential impacts on the future roll-out of large-scale deployment of offshore renewable energy, the market perspective considering existing or alternative (decentralised) systems and all other environmental (like GHG reductions), ecological, social and economic impacts along the value chain.\nIt should increase incentives for investment and economies of scale in offshore bringing down costs and create new business models and services.","The European Green Deal expects to transform Europe into a fair and prosperous society with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy with no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050. To decarbonise Europe, land-based and offshore renewables must become the main energy source, while keeping the stability and resilience of the European Energy System. Research and Innovation is still needed to be able to achieve a full system transformation and to realize the ambition of other EU policies like the Clean Planet for all, the SET-Plan, and the New Circular Economy Strategy and to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (in particular SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy and SDG 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure.\nGiven that the topic contains two subtopics, the specific challenge for the first one, about the development of land-based renewable energy technologies and their integration into the energy system, includes in particular the following:\nRenewable energy-based systems for district heating and cooling (DHC) and for cogeneration of heat and power (CHP) can play a key role in energy system integration, and make a significant contribution to the decarbonisation of the energy system. The Energy System Integration Communication points as one of the solutions towards an acceleration of smart, highly-efficient, renewables-based district heating and cooling networks[[COM2020(299) https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/energy_system_integration_strategy_.pdf. Renewable energy-based DHC and CHP systems that are at the same time robust, reliable and flexible to respond to peak demands require effective and efficient combinations of different renewable energy sources in the same system. This is because for example solar thermal technologies are challenged by sunshine hours, bioenergy by biomass availability and geothermal heating by geology, hydrology and land availability. Research and innovation are necessary to develop the renewable energy-based DHC and CHP systems of the future that are secure, cost-effective, affordable and robust to renewable energy fluctuations. These innovative approaches will have to take into account the specific conditions of the different geographical regions of Europe. Digital solutions can be an important enabler for the operation of multi-source DHC and CHP networks.\nSimilarly, the specific challenge for the subtopic on demonstration of innovative technologies to enable future large scale deployment of offshore renewable energy includes in particular the following:\nThe Commission’s long-term strategy, A Clean planet for all, identifies offshore renewable technologies, amongst others, as a key energy system for the Clean Energy Transition. It provides estimates for the offshore wind capacity in Europe of 240-440 GW by 2050, compared to about 22 GW today, while other offshore renewables follow a more modest scenario. This increase would represent a paradigm shift in the European energy system and require a modern infrastructure to seamlessly integrate the power of offshore resources in the energy system via the grid to onshore, or via the option of power-to-X taking into account grid constraints, investments and evolving /new energy market design.\nThis buildout needs to ensure cost efficiency and to foster the green economy, while protecting the environment and biodiversity, and assuring a just transition. There is a need for more efficient, cost-effective, affordable and secure technologies using wind, solar, wave and/or tidal resources, considering the potential of the different European sea basins (Baltic Sea, North Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea) and the complementarity of resources to reach the best capacity factor and optimized use of all the power equipment. At the same time, developed solutions should ensure resource efficient use of raw materials, in particular critical raw materials.","","","68,000,000.00","more than 1 million","","","","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-2-1-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=;typeCodes=1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCode=H2020;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=H2020-LC-GD-2020;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=callTopicSearchTableState"
"Develop and demonstrate a 100 MW electrolyser upscaling the link between renewables and commercial/industrial applications","The challenge for this topic is to develop larger modules than the state of the art, with reduced balance of plant, managing efficiently the input power, the output hydrogen and oxygen streams, as well as the heat flows, while ensuring the reliability of the system and reducing the footprint through a more compact design. It is expected that the development of bigger modules will help create economies of scale, thus leading to further cost reductions.\nThe modules will then be assembled into a 100MW electrolyser system, which will be tested and demonstrated in real life conditions, operating flexibly to harvest maximum renewable power. The system will provide grid-balancing services as well as supplying renewable hydrogen to a commercial/industrial application. The hydrogen purity should meet the hydrogen market requirements. The output pressure should be designed to fulfil, when possible, the required pressure for the hydrogen application targeted - including buffer storage needs if any - and reduce as far as possible the need for dedicated hydrogen compression units downstream. The performance and the durability of the electrolyser operating dynamically need to be assessed and potential safety issues addressed.\nThe activities related to the development of test methodologies, protocols and procedures for the performance and durability assessment of electrolyser components could envisage a collaboration with JRC in order to support the EU-wide harmonisation of testing protocols to benchmark performance and quantify technology progress. Where possible, the collaboration with JRC could include electrolyser component testing.","2020-09-22","2021-01-26","17:00:00","false","Horizon 2020","European Union","EU+Associated countries","LC-GD-2-2-2020","","The scope of this project is to install and operate a 100 MW electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen, as energy carrier or as a feedstock.

"Demonstration of systemic solutions for the territorial deployment of the circular economy","It is essential that the transition to a sustainable, resource-efficient and circular economic model also delivers on social objectives and contributes to sustainable human development.\nThe circular economy concept should be a central component in local and regional economies, which have a suitable scale for closing resource loops, creating sustainable circular ecosystems and designing participatory community-based innovation schemes. An increasing number of cities, regions, industries and businesses are engaged in testing and improving circularity in their territories, economic sectors, value chains and services. Nevertheless, the concrete implementation of systemic solutions for the territorial deployment of the circular economy still needs to be demonstrated and replicated effectively in other areas. In particular, a major challenge is how to effectively apply the circular economy concept beyond traditional resource recovery in waste and water sectors. The EU added value can be obtained through the demonstration of territorial systemic circular solutions in one territory and their replication in other areas in Europe. This process of demonstration and replication of circular systemic solutions will multiply the local contribution to achieving the policy targets of the European Green Deal, the Circular Economy Action Plan[2], the Bioeconomy Strategy[3] and the European Industrial Strategy[4].","2020-09-22","2021-01-26","17:00:00","false","Horizon 2020","European Union","EU+Associated countries","LC-GD-3-2-2020","","Proposals funded under this topic will form part of the demonstration projects for the implementation of the European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and must be carried out in close cooperation and coordination with it. The CCRI is part of the new Circular Economy Action Plan and aims to support the implementation of circular economy solutions at local and regional scale. The CCRI will be implemented in the coming months: https://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/index.cfm?pg=circular.\n\nEach proposal is expected to implement and demonstrate circular systemic solutions for the territorial deployment of the circular economy (including the circular bioeconomy) in one ‘circular territorial cluster’.\n\nA ‘circular territorial cluster’ (hereinafter referred to as ‘cluster’) is a socio‑economic and environmental system composed of all relevant actors and dimensions to implement, demonstrate and facilitate the replication of at least one circular systemic solution (hereinafter referred to as ‘systemic solution’). In this context, a systemic solution is a cross-sectoral demonstration project for the territorial deployment of a circular and climate-neutral economy. Examples of relevant actors for a cluster are: public administrations and utilities; private sector services and industries, including small and medium enterprises (SMEs), scientific and innovator communities; financial intermediaries; civil society, including citizens and non-governmental organisations and philanthropy. National governments could also play an important role in providing support to the implementation of these systemic solutions. Each cluster should include a geographically cohesive territory (e.g. a group of neighbouring urban, peri-urban and rural areas, not necessarily limited by administrative or national borders) or territories, linked by a systemic solution. The composition and dimension of a cluster should be clearly defined and justified in the proposal.\n\nIdeally each cluster should have a Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) in which the proposed systemic solution is embedded.\n\nIt is essential that the systemic solutions implemented demonstrate the role of the territorial circular economy to reconcile our economies and human activities with the planetary boundaries and to respond to citizens’ needs in the wake of systemic crisis such as climate change, pollution, waste generation, biodiversity loss and the adverse socio-economic and environmental impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. The systemic solutions implemented should increase resilience and provide concrete options for socio-economic recovery as well as generating sustainable and inclusive growth in their clusters. Sustainability, regeneration of ecosystems, inclusiveness and social justice should be at the core of each systemic solution. Particular attention should be given to avoid social, gender and intergenerational inequalities. Potential distributional effects of moving from a linear towards a circular economy should also be addressed in order to produce just and fair outcomes, to boost urban and regional economies and create jobs.\n\nThe systemic solutions implemented should address economic, social and environmental dimensions of the transition towards a circular economy and include science, technology and governance components. They should demonstrate circular governance models and support the active participation of all relevant actors in each cluster. These systemic solutions should prove the effectiveness and sustainability of circular business models. They should support a sustainable and effective symbiosis within and between economic sectors, foster cooperation along and/or across value chains and increase the integration between production, services and consumption.\n\nIt is essential that the systemic solutions implemented address the major challenge of effectively applying the circular economy concept beyond resource management and recovery in the waste and water sectors. It is essential that systemic solutions, and the economic sectors involved in them, are selected and based on a detailed analysis of the cluster’s socio-economic needs to be addressed, circular potential to be exploited, challenges to be tackled and, when feasible, smart specialisation priorities. The selection of economic sectors in each cluster should be clearly defined and justified in the proposals and, when relevant, it should take into account international dimensions with regards to value and supply chains. In addition, thought should be given to the importance of the new Circular Economy Action Plan key product value chains - batteries and vehicles, electronics and ICT, packaging, plastics, textiles, construction and buildings, food, water and nutrients - to the economy of Europe as well as delivering on Green Deal objectives.\n\nThe systemic solutions implemented should also help to create critical mass for public and private investments and public procurement pull for new solutions, and should contribute to overcoming market failures. They could test public-private partnership models, interregional cooperation mechanisms and multilevel funding synergies useful for de-risking business investments. They should improve consumers’ understanding and acceptance of circular and climate-neutral services and products. Proposals should also explore synergies with other funds, including Cohesion Policy funds, the Just Transition Fund and InvestEU, hereby showing pathways to market uptake.\n\nThe systemic solutions implemented could include criteria and elements of eco-design, industrial symbiosis and industrial ecology. They could promote the role of ecosystems services and nature-based solutions in the circular and climate-neutral economy. They should promote the use of natural capital accounting into business strategy and decision making.\n\nThe systemic solutions implemented should facilitate technology deployment, including digital technologies. Systemic solutions should also facilitate the industrial exploitation of the already demonstrated research results and, when relevant, contribute towards connecting SMEs to the value chains of larger companies.\n\nSystemic solutions should ensure the sustainable circular use and valorisation of local resources. Special attention should be dedicated to more efficient and sustainable businesses, processes and value chains promoting zero-waste solutions and recycling quality, increasing products’ function recovery and reuse, using secondary raw materials (including critical raw materials) and valorising local bio-based feedstock.\n\nIt is essential that the systemic solutions implemented also involve one or more community‑based innovation schemes, such as local repairing schemes for products. These schemes are expected to promote circular social practices and address environmental, behavioural and cultural aspects of the territorial transition towards a circular economy. The systemic solutions implemented are expected to include specific training for local actors and education services for local communities.\n\nEach systemic solution should identify, analyse and when relevant, quantify the economic, social and environmental benefits and challenges related to its implementation and demonstration in its respective cluster. It should include the monitoring and evaluation of the cluster’s transition towards a circular economy, identify its strengths and weaknesses as well as their causes. It should analyse regulatory obstacles and drivers and provide clear and precise policy recommendations to improve circular economy related EU and national/local regulation (including, when relevant, inputs on standardisation and certification). It should analyse the effectiveness of the available financial schemes for territorial circular solutions and propose concrete options for their improvement. Environmental externalities should be addressed and life cycle assessment (LCA) should be included in each systemic solution. Benchmark cost and environmental footprint of each systemic solution should be compared with equivalent linear solutions. The information and data collected and the knowledge gathered by the projects under this topic must be shared with the CCRI. CCRI will ensure a wider dissemination among policy-makers and stakeholders not involved in these proposals.\n\nIt is crucial that the systemic solutions implemented and their business models have a high replicability and scalability potential. This is fundamental to facilitate the replication of circular solutions in other areas.\n\nIt is essential that proposals dedicate resources to engage in cooperation with other circular territorial clusters funded under this topic and to transfer relevant information and good practices to policy-makers and stakeholders not involved in the proposals. Actions should contribute to the open access to information on circular systemic solutions across Europe. Setting up twinning exercises between the clusters could be an efficient way to facilitate the exchange of experiences and expand to new activities along and across value chains. The cooperation and coordination between projects and clusters under this topic and their dissemination activities must be carried out in close cooperation and coordination with the CCRI.\n\nIt is essential that proposals ensure complementarity and cooperation with existing relevant European projects and initiatives on the circular economy and the circular bioeconomy, with special reference to the local and regional scale, and avoid overlapping and repetitions.\n\nThe technology readiness level (TRL) of each circular solution should be within the 6-7 range at the end of the project. Each proposal should clearly state the starting and end TRL of the key technology, processes and value chains targeted in the project.","Proposals are expected to contribute to the implementation of the CCRI by providing policy-makers, public and private investors and local communities with concrete and demonstrated examples of circular systemic solutions at local and regional scale with the following impacts:\ndecoupling of economic and human activities from the consumption of finite resources and GHG emissions, ensuring the transition towards circular and climate-neutral economy;\nimproved sustainability and circularity of clusters’ economic sectors, natural ecosystems, management and valorisation of local resources;\nemergence of circular business opportunities and a structured pipeline of investment projects;\nincreased circular and climate-neutral practices among citizens and their participation in systemic solutions;\ncreation of jobs in the short to medium term;\nmore effective development of circular solutions through knowledge transfer between the territorial clusters funded under this topic and other territories across EU member states and associated countries ;\nmore effective widespread uptake and easier replication, scalability and visibility of circular systemic solutions and hence multiplication of the economic, social and environmental benefits to achieve the policy targets of the European Green Deal, Circular Economy Action Plan, EU Bioeconomy Strategy and the European Industrial Strategy at local, regional, national, European and international levels.","Boosting circularity is part of the policy response to address systemic crisis such as climate change, pollution, waste generation, and biodiversity loss. Circular economy can play an important role in the EU’s recovery from the adverse socio-economic and environment impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, by providing systemic solutions for sustainable growth and economic recovery. As indicated in the European Green Deal Communication, with increasing global consumption and growing pressure on resources there is an urgent need to decouple economic growth from resource use and to ensure a swift transition to climate-neutral and circular solutions. Europe also needs to increase its resilience in the face of uncertainty in the supply of critical raw materials and to increase the security of its value chains such as for example the new Circular Economy Action Plan key product value chains: batteries and vehicles, electronics and ICT, packaging, plastics, textiles, construction and buildings, food, water and nutrients[1]. A circular economy which is sustainable, regenerative, inclusive and just can help our economies to function within the boundaries of our planet by restoring natural systems, reducing GHG emissions and minimising loss of natural capital and biodiversity. It can also connect environmental policies with social justice through just transition ensuring environmental sustainability, jobs and social inclusion. Where relevant, attention should also be paid to occupational health and safety aspects and potential challenges of the transition towards a circular economy.","","","60,000,000.00","more than 10 millions","","","","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-3-2-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=;typeCodes=1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCode=H2020;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=H2020-LC-GD-2020;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=callTopicSearchTableState"
"Building and renovating in an energy and resource efficient way","With rising focus on the building sector (e.g. the ‘renovation wave’ initiative of the European Green Deal) in view of the full decarbonisation by 2050, the built environment remains a strategic domain for R&I. The priority is the design and construction of new or retrofitting of existing buildings as zero-emission/zero-pollution[1], positive energy-houses in sustainable green neighbourhoods. There are two major components in this transition. Firstly, a transition in designing and constructing buildings to reduce their embodied emissions and to increase the energy efficiency of their operation; the same applies to retrofitting existing buildings to increase their efficiency. Secondly, a transition to energy positive buildings (producing electricity, covering their heating and cooling needs and contributing to the energy grid stability) with sustainable, renewable energy technologies. These two components are closely linked, since greater building efficiency can reduce demand for heating and cooling and allow a greater range of zero emission technologies to become viable. It also means, reducing demand through effective building designs, including those that are adapted to their local environments (bioclimatic architecture conditions) and use.

"Green airports and ports as multimodal hubs for sustainable and smart mobility","A clear commitment of the European Green Deal is that “transport should become drastically less polluting”, highlighting in particular the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in aviation and waterborne transport. In aviation, traffic volumes are expected to increase significantly by 2050 and the sector is already generating 14% of the EU GHG emissions from transport. At the same time, waterborne transport accounts for approximately 90% of global trade and 13% of EU transport GHG emissions, while also experiencing continuous growth. In this context, airports, maritime and inland ports play a major role, both as inter-connection points in the respective transport networks, but also as major multimodal nodes, logistics hubs and commercial sites, linking with other transport modes, hinterland connections and integrated with cities. As such, green airports and ports, as multimodal hubs in the post COVID-19 era for sustainable and smart mobility have a great potential to immediately contribute to start driving the transition towards GHG-neutral aviation, shipping and wider multimodal mobility already by 2025. This topic therefore addresses innovative concepts and solutions for airports and ports, in order to urgently reduce transport GHG emissions and increase their contribution to mitigating climate change.","2020-09-22","2021-01-26","17:00:00","false","Horizon 2020","European Union","EU+Associated countries","LC-GD-5-1-2020","","Building on best practices (technological, non-technological and social), as well as ongoing projects and planned initiatives in European airports and ports, actions should address the activities EITHER under area A) Green Airports OR under area B) Green Ports.

For Green Ports, each consortium should include at least one inland port. All consortia should also be multidisciplinary in nature by including partners with the appropriate complementary knowledge and skills (e.g. industry, consultancy, airport/port authorities, academia). All participating airports or ports must be from different EU Member States and/or Associated Countries.\n\nIn line with the Union’s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged.","accelerated deployment of sustainable alternative fuels (including advanced biofuels), green hydrogen and electromobility in transport, as well as sustainable energy supply and storage and waste heat recovery in airports and ports;\nclean energy/fuel production and distribution (particularly green hydrogen and electricity) and increased alternative (bio-) fuel supply, with re-fueling and re-charging capabilities;\ngreen airports and ports as multimodal hubs, optimising passenger and freight flows for low emission mobility, in a context of much stricter public health criteria;\nenergy-efficient and green airport and port operations and buildings, green and smart logistics, integration with other low-emission transport modes (in particular rail) and promoting effective modal shifts;\nreduced aviation, waterborne and other transport emissions, as well as improved air quality, biodiversity, contribution to the circular economy and reduction of noise at airports and ports;\nreduced emissions for cities and urban mobility, as well as improved city integration for airports and ports;\nclear commitments and contributions to Europe-wide take up of technological, non-technological and socially innovative solutions during and beyond the project are expected, which could be in the form of follow-up actions, for instance supported by EU’s Connecting Europe Facility or other funding programmes;\nsignificant, direct and immediate contribution to the achievement of the European Green Deal, as well as other EU transport policy objectives (including TEN-T), while strengthening the competitiveness of the European transport sector.","A clear commitment of the European Green Deal is that “transport should become drastically less polluting”, highlighting in particular the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in aviation and waterborne transport. In aviation, traffic volumes are expected to increase significantly by 2050 and the sector is already generating 14% of the EU GHG emissions from transport. At the same time, waterborne transport accounts for approximately 90% of global trade and 13% of EU transport GHG emissions, while also experiencing continuous growth. In this context, airports, maritime and inland ports play a major role, both as inter-connection points in the respective transport networks, but also as major multimodal nodes, logistics hubs and commercial sites, linking with other transport modes, hinterland connections and integrated with cities. As such, green airports and ports, as multimodal hubs in the post COVID-19 era for sustainable and smart mobility have a great potential to immediately contribute to start driving the transition towards GHG-neutral aviation, shipping and wider multimodal mobility already by 2025. This topic therefore addresses innovative concepts and solutions for airports and ports, in order to urgently reduce transport GHG emissions and increase their contribution to mitigating climate change.","","","100,000,000.00","more than 10 millions","Collective","","","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-5-1-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=;typeCodes=1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCode=H2020;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=H2020-LC-GD-2020;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=callTopicSearchTableState"
"Testing and demonstrating systemic innovations in support of the Farm-to-Fork Strategy","The Farm to Fork Strategy, which is at the heart of the European Green Deal, aims to address the challenges and accelerate the transition to sustainable food systems, to ensure that the economic, social and environmental foundations of food and nutrition security are not compromised for current and future generations. It places emphasis on enabling a “just transition” for all actors of the food systems, in which also social inequalities are reduced, food poverty is addressed, and a fair income for all actors is ensured. It requires and builds on innovative solutions that can be scaled up, such as agro-ecological and organic practices, alternative sources of protein (e.g. plant-based, ocean-based, insect-based, etc.), sustainable food from the oceans and aquaculture, and personalised advice relating to sustainable healthy diets[10].

The projects should focus on upscaling innovations (TRL level 5-7), and can include limited research activities to address specific gaps for solution building, testing and demonstration. Particular attention should be given to understand behaviours, motivations and barriers, with a view to maximizing the uptake of solutions. The innovations delivered by the proposals have to take into account the EU market regulatory frameworks (e.g. safety, environmental) and relevant requirements.\nWhere appropriate, capitalise on existing testing and demonstration facilities to strengthen their capacity to address the challenge and showcase solutions.\nDelivering and implementing an action plan for dissemination, communication and engagement, for building awareness, education and skills relevant to the solutions on a European scale, in and beyond the regions where the activities take place, among businesses, investors, entrepreneurs, institutions, stakeholders and citizens.

It should now also become the global standard for sustainability. Although the transition to more sustainable systems is in its infancy, it remains a big challenge to feed a fast-growing world population and steer food systems within a safe and just operating space - encompassing planetary health, economic viability and social welfare, and including human health. Many current production practices and consumption patterns still result in air, water and soil pollution, contribute to the loss of biodiversity and to climate change, challenge animal welfare and consume excessive amounts of natural resources, including water and energy, while an important part of food is wasted. At the same time, unbalanced diets contribute to obesity and other nutrition-related, non-communicable diseases. Here are some of the facts:\n\nAgriculture is responsible for 10.3% of the EU’s GHG emissions[1]; Food is a significant source of GHG-emissions contributing to about 17% of EU household emissions, similar to housing (22%)[2];\nNitrogen and phosphorus cycles exceed their safe operating space in Europe, respectively by a factor of 3.3 and 2 resulting in diffuse pollution of terrestrial, aquatic and atmospheric ecosystems[3];\nThe value of the direct contribution of insect pollinators to EU agricultural output has been estimated at around € 15 billion per year[4]. Pesticides have been shown to negatively affect pollinator populations[5]. In addition, excess pesticide can leach into soils and water potentially leading to wider biodiversity losses and impacting human health.\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) linked to the excessive and inappropriate use of antimicrobials in animal and human healthcare leads to an estimated 33,000 human deaths in the EU/EEA every year[6], and considerable healthcare costs;\nAbout 20% of the food produced in the EU is being wasted[7];\nOne in five EU adults are obese and half are overweight[8]. On average, nearly one in eight children aged 7-8 is obese in EU countries[9]. Many Europeans die prematurely, or suffer from illnesses due to diet related diseases.\nIn addition, the COVID19 pandemic highlighted the importance of robust and resilient EU food systems within a sustainable, circular bioeconomy to respond to global shocks and disruptions in supply chains, and to mitigate socio-economic impacts of crises notably as regards food poverty.","","","74,000,000.00","more than 10 millions","Collective","","","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-6-1-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=;typeCodes=1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCode=H2020;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=H2020-LC-GD-2020;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=callTopicSearchTableState"

The scalability plan should include diffusion of innovative solutions, and a process for commitments in adopting large-scale restoration within governance and financing systems, so other relevant communities can replicate the upscaling across the EU and internationally. It should seek guarantees for the non-reversibility and/or continuity of up-scaled restoration activities and/or further replication and/or expansion, implementation of sustainable management practices and monitoring after the end of the projects.\nSetting baselines, goals and a monitoring framework for the projects: why an activity is being undertaken, what changes are expected and by when, and how changes are monitored in order to determine if the action was successful in relation to the original goals. Activities should be prioritised according to their urgency for addressing upscaling restoration challenges, the restoration potential of degraded ecosystems, the significance of research for supporting EU policy needs, their contribution to the international biodiversity agenda, and their potential to trigger transformative change.\nRestoration actions should be paired with supportive and robust management practices that reduce pressures and direct habitat damage at the local scale, and empower civil society in planning and deployment of restoration and maintenance of its achievements to support restoration efforts in the long term.\nPrioritisation should be informed by social, economic and ecological conditions and recovery efficiency to ensure restoration efforts are resilient and efficient. Approaches should be based on existing knowledge from prior research or experience and tested restoration methods [13] and should seek complementarity with LIFE projects [14]. To increase the scale, scope and pace of restoration, efforts should be based on evidence, better understanding and communication of ecosystem service recovery and thresholds for effective ecosystem restoration, and the inclusive involvement of social and economic actors.\nActivities related to improving ecosystem condition should be integrated into best practice monitoring activities within respective monitoring governance schemes[15]. No new restoration monitoring approaches should be developed. Actions should explicitly include deliverables which apply (or test, if necessary) monitoring schemes with efficiency and output indicators related to restoration, its benefits and trade-offs.\nActions should promote innovative funding, cross-sectoral collaborations and social participation to support the design, implementation and monitoring of sustainable and effective restoration efforts. They should explore how upscaling and mainstreaming of ecosystem restoration could facilitate systemic transformation in governance, policy making, financing, public procurement, economic development, social innovation, infrastructure and regional strategic planning.\nIn line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged for adapting the upscaling approaches for restoration demonstrated for use in European conditions[16] and applying them to harness transformative change internationally.\nProject consortia must evidence that they have the rights to undertake actions on the areas to be restored. No land purchase or lease can be funded under this topic. Projects are expected to mobilise additional funding or in-kind contributions when implementing restoration actions.\n\nProposals should dedicate appropriate resources to develop joint deliverables with all projects funded under this topic and for cooperation with other projects. Actions should use existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms relevant for restoration and nature-based solutions, giving open access to its results.","The project results are expected to contribute to:\nmaintained and enhanced natural carbon sinks and reduced greenhouse gas emissions through the important role of biodiversity, local reversal of the degradation of ecosystems, recovery of ecosystem functions, increased connectivity and resilience of ecosystems, and improved delivery of a range of ecosystem services[17];\nthe objectives of the European Green Deal, including the EU commitment to reduce emission by 50-55% by 2030 and become net carbon-neutral by 2050; the implementation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030[18] and the EU Nature Directives[19], the Water and Marine Strategy Framework Directives, the Farm-to-Fork Strategy, the Pollinators Initiative, the Climate Law, the Bioeconomy Strategy and Action Plan, EU Urban Policies, and the revised EU Adaptation Strategy; supporting the EU Covenant of Mayors, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030), the UN Decade of Restoration including land/sea degradation neutrality, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals;\nwidespread and innovative scaling-up of ecosystem restoration to maintain and enhance natural carbon sinks and other ecosystem services, with a view to significantly reducing the carbon and environmental footprint of Europe;\nincreased restoration through uptake of public-private partnerships and (voluntary) market-based incentives for business and individuals within restoration initiatives, including as the result of trans-disciplinary research and stakeholder engagement to help identify co-funding for long-term maintenance and buy-in from the private sector;\nenhanced empowerment, engagement and reconnection of local communities with nature and increased social awareness on restoration actions, and their benefits;\ntransformational change supporting a just transition based on investing in nature together with vulnerable regions and communities improving their resilience of in the face of rapid changes in climate and environment, economies and social conditions.","Underpinned by knowledge in the latest IPCC and IPBES reports, large-scale ecosystem restoration is urgent – the window of opportunity is closing rapidly. It needs a systemic approach to deliver tangible benefits on the European Green Deal actions for climate (mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk reduction), biodiversity, zero pollution and sustainable food systems (from farm to fork), health and wellbeing. Actions under this topic should therefore be pivotal in demonstrating and promoting systemic solutions for upscaling urgent restoration to increase biodiversity and support a wide range of ecosystem services, as requested in the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 for damaged terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems.\n\nResilient, healthy ecosystems are natural carbon stocks and sinks. They can remove CO2 from the atmosphere and support adaptation to climate change and disaster risk reduction. In addition to delivering a wide range of other services (oxygen source, improved health and well-being, recreation, water retention and purification, air quality, nutrient cycling or pollination), ecosystems are essential in a wide range of sectors which impact the everyday life of Europe’s citizens (food, feed, fibre or fuel provision across the bioeconomy). However, biodiversity is being lost and ecosystems are degrading at an alarming rate. Pressures on biodiversity are increasing at a faster rate than the efforts to protect it[1]. The integrity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and their capacity to deliver a wide range of essential services to people, will be further undermined by the effects of unavoidable climate change. There is therefore a need to strengthen their resilience against environmental and climate stressors while integrating the local socio-economic specificities of their surrounding environment.\n\nWhile solutions for the restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem services are available now, they are neither up-scaled nor integrated enough in today’s governance, investment or policy support landscapes. Research and demonstration on how to scale up technical and non-technical approaches for the spatial and social-economic integration of restoration impacts is therefore needed. The environmental emergency highlights the limits of current management approaches and calls for investment in innovative, sustainable and effective restoration including through mobilising innovative funding and cross-sectoral collaborations that could trigger transformational change. Moreover, the global biodiversity post-2020 framework seeks voluntary commitments by business and stakeholders to invest in biodiversity and new approaches to speed up actions in the framework of the UN decade for restoration.\n\nFrom increased social awareness to more engagement with the private sector, there is a distinct need to build trans-disciplinary collaborations at all scales and across relevant ecosystem types. Win-win solutions and multi-purpose usage that support local biodiversity while delivering specific services and socio-economic benefits are sought. Hence, this topic seeks answers on how to frame transformational change which supports a just transition[2] – to show how investing in nature restoration can explicitly help vulnerable regions and communities to improve their resilience to social and environmental shocks, when rapid changes in climate and environment, economies and social conditions occur.\n\nThis topic therefore responds to the urgent double challenge of (i) accelerating transformative change through (ii) upscaling restoration of ecosystems at sea or on land.","","","80,000,000.00","more than 10 millions","","","","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-7-1-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=;typeCodes=1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCode=H2020;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=H2020-LC-GD-2020;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=callTopicSearchTableState"
"Innovative, systemic zero-pollution solutions to protect health, environment and natural resources from persistent and mobile chemicals\n","Taking into account latest policy needs and developments, this call topic aims at establishing new knowledge, exploring the feasibility of new or improved technologies and demonstrating innovative solutions to protect health, environment and natural resources from persistent and mobile chemicals. Selected projects are expected to advance our knowledge on health impacts and environmental effects and to address and preferably prevent a specific pollution problem involving contamination of environmental resources (such as soil, sediments, air, food and drinking water). The solutions developed should lead to cost-effective prevention, monitoring and to, as a last resort, mitigation or elimination of the issues (e.g. mitigation or remediation efforts in particularly affected geographic areas). They should also lead to better understanding of environmental fate and help proactively prevent negative impacts from persistent and mobile chemicals (and, where relevant, their precursors) on humans and the environment. The projects may include appropriate technologies, business, governance and social innovation aspects and the demonstration of innovative solutions in a relevant environment (TRL 4-6). In particular, projects may consider analytical methods and monitoring, enabling to quantify entire groups of persistent and mobile chemicals in food, soil or drinking water.

There is also solid scientific evidence substantiating health and environmental concerns related to chemicals. The European Green Deal includes a commitment to a zero-pollution ambition for a toxic-free environment. In this context, it specifically mentions the need to rapidly address the risks posed by hazardous chemicals and, more specifically, very persistent chemicals.\n\nPollution from persistent and mobile chemicals is often a systemic problem, as it is driven by factors closely related to the prevailing ways of production and consumption and is reinforced by missing appropriate technical solutions, including (bio)remediation and monitoring techniques for the environment (including the marine environment). These chemicals also pose challenges for regulatory authorities to develop or enforce effective policies.\n\nAn example of these very persistent chemicals is per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of thousands of manmade chemicals that are widely used in various consumer and industrial products (e.g. water- and stain repellent textiles, fire-fighting foams, plastics, food contact materials and cosmetics) and to which citizens and the environment are exposed. They are an increasing concern as they are persistent in the environment, very mobile, toxic and can bioaccumulate. For these reasons, they are found everywhere in the environment and their concentration increases over time, creating additional risks for human health and ecosystems. There are examples of contamination by PFAS of water and soil in most EU countries, which are costly or in some cases impossible to remediate. The overall costs to society from PFAS alone as an example are estimated by one source to be € 52-84bn across Europe (Nordic Council of Ministers, 2019)[1], which is likely to be an underestimate, as it includes only a limited range of health effects (high cholesterol, impaired immune system, and cancer). Some studies have shown negative effects of PFAS on the immune system, including a reduced response to vaccines. Similar effects are known also in connection to other kinds of persistent chemicals. This is of concern considering the current COVID-19 pandemic.","","","40,000,000.00","more than 10 millions","","","","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-8-1-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=;typeCodes=1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCode=H2020;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=H2020-LC-GD-2020;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=callTopicSearchTableState"

It should provide an integrated, timely and persistent description of the ocean including at least physics, biogeochemistry, geology and human activities;\nThe integration of data from existing or new automated sensors and autonomous mobile and fixed platforms, additional structured and unstructured data, alternative sources such as private companies data, citizen science or historic data collected before the digital age (chemical, physical, biological and ecological) and delivered through EMODnet and Copernicus;\nThe implementation of data and model outputs in state-of-art standards and formats (INSPIRE, FAIR, ontologies, …) compliant with their exploitation by applications and appropriate user interfaces based on big data and artificial intelligence technologies;\nThe development of what-if scenarios to validate the representativeness of the digital ocean simulator in “real conditions of use” by configuring different ocean conditions and exploiting AI/data analytics tools, on concrete cases in local or regional sea basins.","The action will deliver a digital interactive framework based on digital technologies compatible of Destination Earth and the Digital Package including an digital ocean simulator based on a high-resolution numerical model of the ocean, including available ocean observation datasets in Europe and digital analytic toolboxes to configure the digital ocean simulator and to access what-if scenarios.\nThis will enable:\nComplementing the core European existing operation ocean forecasting and ocean climate services provided by Copernicus to European public, scientific and private users, with a simulation capacity that will enable the plug-in of vertical applications based on innovative solutions (sectorial methods, coupled models, statistical approaches, assimilation, ensembles, massive computing, deep learning, …) to support science-driven policies implementation;\nMoving towards a European Ocean Observing System, fully integrated with multidisciplinary observatories of estuarine, coastal and marine environments and socio-ecological systems, and promoting shared data management strategies (infrastructure development, data standardization, sharing, availability, access, interoperability, visualisation and use of data according to the FAIR principles).\nIt will:\nSupport science-driven approaches to policies implementations by users that reinforce conservation and ecosystem-based management of marine habitats/green infrastructure, improve the planning and management of marine areas, and safeguard productivity and biodiversity of marine ecosystems and how this is influenced by the river-to-sea interaction;\nIncrease citizen engagement, taking into account cultural and emotional aspects, through increased awareness and understanding of the dynamics, interactions and evolution of seas and oceans and their role in our well-being and survival, and promoting bottom-up actions, empowering citizens in innovative co-designed services and new project designs where citizens' opinions are considered from the initial stages;\nEncourage and enable the infusion of ‘non-scientific data streams’, in a coordinated way, through citizens engaged in data gathering, and through joint efforts from a community composed of users of the sea, including private companies, public authorities, social innovators, researchers, citizens and policy makers;\nSupport industry to develop new business models and opportunities in ocean data and related services.\nFacilitate the operationalising of long term observing systems and contribute to the objectives of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.","Fit for purpose and sustained ocean and sea observations are essential for understanding and forecasting ocean behaviour. Measures to protect marine social-ecological systems and support the blue economy are based on these insights and forecasts. 10-20 years ago, marine data from these observations were difficult to find, only accessible through long and sometimes costly negotiations and hard to put together to create a complete picture because of different standards, nomenclature and baselines.\n\nFor the past two decades, the European Union invested in policies and infrastructures to enable this sustainability and fitness for purpose. Its Member States, together with neighbours, have created an unrivalled marine data, modelling and forecasting infrastructure, essentially based on EMODNet – the European Marine Observation and Data Network - gathering in-situ and reference ocean data in Europe and the Copernicus marine environment monitoring service (CMEMS) providing European and global operational ocean forecasting and ocean climate services based on the assimilation of these in-situ ocean observation into numerical ocean models. They are supported by European Research Infrastructures and by major R&D projects to deploy ocean observatories at sea and collect marine data (e.g. Eurofleets+, EuroArgo, Jerico, Danubius, EMBRC, EMSO, ICOS, LifeWatch, etc). Cooperation and the principles of free and open access, interoperability, and “measure once, use many times”, were largely promoted, as well as the added-value demonstrated through Copernicus, the European Research Framework Programmes FP7 and Horizon 2020, Blue Cloud and EMODnet activities.\n\nThe Digital Twin of the Ocean concept is to make a step further by integrating all European assets related to seas and oceans (data, models, physical ocean observatories at sea) with digital technologies (cloud, super HPC capacities, AI and data analytics) into a digital component that represents a consistent high-resolution, multi-dimensional and (nearly) real-time description of the ocean. It will contribute to the Commission’s Green Deal and Digital Package commitments to develop a very high precision digital model of the Earth (Destination Earth initiative).\n\nAI and analytics, thematic or sectorial models and computing power will transform data into knowledge. They will facilitate co-creation and inter-disciplinary approaches between natural sciences, humanities and social sciences for the co-construction of methods, expertise and applications to support decision making. This digital view of the ocean will enable a multi-angle perception of the ocean: its physics, chemistry, geology, biology as well as the environmental and socio-economic impact of human activity.\n\nIt will be a simulator to test scenarios that deal with different evolutions of the ocean environment. It will empower citizens, governments and industries to collectively share the responsibility to monitor, preserve and enhance marine and coastal habitats, while supporting also a sustainable blue economy (fishing, aquaculture, transport, renewable energy, etc.). It will enable measures to increase resilience to climate change, improve disaster risk management, develop spatial plans, report on the state of the environment, coastal or offshore activity and measure its impact.","","","12,000,000.00","more than 10 millions","","","","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/lc-gd-9-3-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=;typeCodes=1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCode=H2020;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=H2020-LC-GD-2020;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=callTopicSearchTableState"

The transformation plan should take an integrated approach to advanced manufacturing and address the innovativeness of processes and products as well as the environmental and social sustainability of manufacturing, as outlined in the EU methodology.\n\nThe roll-out of an advanced manufacturing training programme which will consist of (1) Cross-border training services to be provided to a critical mass of SMEs in cooperation with technology or training centres capable of delivering training services to SMEs in advanced manufacturing and (2) The development of framework(s) for training programmes ready to be scaled-up under the European Social Fund.\nThe training services should include practical, ""on-site"" training delivered at facilities where technologies can be tested and demonstrated such as pilot lines (e.g. ""learning by doing"", ""learning factories"", fab labs). Proposals should include solutions to overcome the challenge of both geographical distance and the gender segregation.\n\nThe consortium will define quality criteria for the trainings. A quality label compatible with the European quality assurance reference framework for vocational education and training (EQAVET[8]) should acknowledge the quality of the trainings provided.\n\nFor this second element of the topic, proposers are encouraged to also build on experiences from actions undertaken under the Blueprint for sectoral cooperation on skills and the identified pilot sectors identified in the Communication on a New Skills Agenda for Europe[9] which could allow a smoother roll-out of the specific frameworks for training programmes.\n\nThe consortium should be formed by a group of partner organisations with proven track records in providing innovation and training services directly to SMEs in the area of advanced manufacturing. The involvement of vocational education and training centres will be necessary to ensure the long-term impact of frameworks for training programmes.\n\nThe projects should aim to achieve critical mass and to better exploit EU-added value. The action may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the criteria for selection of users and suppliers for which financial support will be granted.\n\nA minimum share of 65% of the total budget shall be allocated to provide direct assistance and trainings (two elements listed above) to SMEs.\n\nWherever appropriate, actions could seek synergies and co-financing from relevant national/regional research and innovation programmes, or from structural funds addressing smart specialisation. Actions combining different sources of financing should include a concrete financial plan detailing the use of these funding sources for the different parts of their activities.\n\nProposers are encouraged to liaise with the Enterprise Europe Network and cluster organisations, in particular for outreach to SMEs having a potential and willingness to adopt advanced manufacturing solutions and/or with specific training needs. Liaison with the relevant regional and cluster partnerships set up in the context of the Smart Specialisation Platform for Industrial Modernisation and the European IPR Helpdesk is also encouraged.","Provide a clear and measurable contribution of the advanced manufacturing assistance and training programme to the innovation performance and environmental and social sustainability of the supported SMEs, as revealed by indicators such as: numbers of new or significantly improved production processes, products or services or new organisational methods; its impact on resource efficiency; its impact on productivity, production lead times, investments and/or turnover; number of SMEs that prepared a concrete plan to upgrade their manufacturing processes during the action; its impact on technical and non­technical competences acquired and workers involvement; a wider impact on job creation is also expected to be measured in the longer term.\n\nFrameworks for training programmes related to advanced manufacturing, ready for implementation within the duration of the action. These should propose a pathway on how to facilitate a further scaling-up under the European Social Fund.","Many SMEs struggle to embrace the Industry 4.0 revolution and the uptake of advanced manufacturing technologies and systems remains a challenge: only one in five manufacturing companies have already used advanced manufacturing solutions[1]. A recent study[2] shows that for nearly three quarters of the firms, the most important barrier to the uptake of advanced manufacturing technologies and systems is the high cost of investments in advanced manufacturing acquisition and the lack of financial resources. About half of all firms also indicate difficulties in assessing the performance and the potential business return of such technologies and/or the lack of skilled personnel required to adopt relevant technologies and business models.\n\nOnly few public initiatives today offer advisory services to manufacturing SMEs to help them assess the performance of advanced manufacturing investments and embrace advanced manufacturing solutions for turning their company towards a next-generation factory with more competitive, smarter and sustainable production ('factory of the future' concept). Besides access to such advice and expertise, also retraining and up-skilling of personnel are vital for the uptake of advanced technologies by industry, and SMEs in particular.[3]\n\nIt is demonstrated that the skills required by SMEs to deploy and innovate with advanced technologies are best acquired through practical trainings in environments where advanced technologies can be demonstrated and tested by engineers and other relevant professionals (e.g. learning by doing, learning factories, fab labs)[4]. Such environments are often an underused source for training activities. Some technology centres[5] in Europe are providing technology facilities and services to SMEs including trainings, but these centres are not evenly distributed across Europe. Besides practical trainings, the curricula in the vocational education is insufficiently addressing advanced technologies and collaboration with other relevant actors, including technology centres.","","","5,700,000.00","more than 1 million","Collective","","","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/innosup-08-2020;freeTextSearchKeyword=;typeCodes=0,1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCode=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=Default;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState"

The description of the pilot should address amongst other: targeted number of computing elements, interconnects and network topologies for exascale, cooling, I/O, etc.\nDefinition of clear and measurable intermediate and final targets to demonstrate the suitability of the pilot system, for example in terms of system performance, performance improvements for the selected applications, power budget and efficiency, scalability, resilience, etc. The proposal should clearly describe the approach to measure and verify each of these targets and should demonstrate that the pilot system would offer a clear approach towards overall reduced power consumption.\nDescription of software issues, including software stack, software scaling and adaptation for heterogeneous systems, software reliability, optimisation, and inclusion of a set of software programming tools and environments, compiler technologies for basic instruction sets and for higher level support of applications at scale with various programming models, etc. Pilot systems should aim to offer a pluralism in European solutions and maximise their integration inside the software stack.\nThe integration of different European cooling systems, including prototype systems for their further testing and development.\nClear identification of the European technology hardware and building blocks and how they are integrated and leveraged in the pilot systems. In particular, proposals have to demonstrate how the pilot system aligns with the efforts of European low power processing technologies, by describing the mechanisms that will be used for that purpose.\nIdentification of a set of ambitious and relevant applications for the system co-design, describing how and when application developers and users will be involved in the co-design process, and what measures will be taken to attract and motivate users and developers to adopt the technologies proposed in the pilot system, in view of maximising their use and acceptance.\nClear timed description of the engineering approach for the pilot systems, indicating for example the timing to development and release of the proposed hardware and software solutions, evaluation, testing, and the validation and deployment of the pilot systems in close-to-operation environments. The approach should also describe the involvement of users and developers (with the eventual re-writing, porting, re-factoring etc. of codes) in a co-design approach.\nDescription of the use of the pilot systems in the operational environment during the life of the project and once the project is completed, including targeted services, communities and applications, etc…\nDescription of mechanisms for cooperation between the pilot systems that would be supported by the action: the successful proposals are expected to establish a close collaboration in order to ensure to the extent possible the convergence and compatibility of the different results and solutions developed in the pilot systems, e.g. hardware/software stacks, components, common or fully interoperable software environments, common or fully interoperable application development platforms, common architectural views, etc. These mechanisms will be formalised in a cooperation framework gathering the selected pilot systems.","Proposals should describe how the proposed work will contribute to the impacts listed below and include a baseline, targets and metrics to measure impact:\nContribution to the realisation of the EuroHPC JU’s overall and specific objectives\nStrengthening scientific leadership as well as the competitiveness and innovation potential of the European industry through the further development and use of European technologies\nContributing to a sustainable exascale HPC supply ecosystem in Europe and ensuring European technological autonomy in this field\nLeveraging the efforts on the European low power processing (in particular the European Processor Initiative) or in open hardware technologies and contributing to the realisation of future exascale system architectures based on such technologies\nMaximising the use of European technologies in users and developers of relevant applications for European scientific and industrial leadership\nCreation, promotion and exploitation potential of European IP\nMaturity of solutions and potential for exploitation in future European exascale HPC components and systems","To demonstrate in pre-operational environments the successful integration of European technology building blocks developed for example in the European Processor Initiative (EPI) and in previously funded EU R&I actions into fully integrated pilot supercomputing systems commensurate with exascale performance objectives along with other European IP such as software tools and application libraries, interconnects, rack design, cooling systems, advanced fabric management, etc... The goal of these pilot supercomputing systems will be to produce a prototype system which can be used in a pre-operational environment, able to execute jobs and run software components designed as part of the pilot programme.\nTwo such pilot supercomputing systems will be supported whose work will be closely inter-coordinated. They will have to demonstrate how the challenges of power efficiency, usability, resiliency and scalability can be met, by considering in particular a strong co-design approach driven by ambitious application requirements. The involved stakeholders should include technology component suppliers, system integrators, supercomputing infrastructure providers and user communities.\n","","","37,000,000.00","more than 10 millions","","","","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/eurohpc-2020-01-a;freeTextSearchKeyword=;typeCodes=0,1;statusCodes=31094503;programCode=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=Default;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState"

Explore also the feasibility of meeting these needs by an interactive platform or any other adequate system.\n\nProposals must develop and validate a methodology to qualify and quantify the needs of start-ups and spin-offs. On this basis, proposals must evaluate the interest of the spin-offs and start-ups to interact with potential partners and investors. And similarly, proposals must evaluate the interest of expert companies, organisations and investors to interact with start-ups and spin-offs.\n\nProposals must show that the envisaged platform or system will bring start-ups and spin-offs in contact with potential partners across networks and with a large geographical reach. Proposals should build on completed and running projects, such as networks of pilot plants [2] or other projects designed to facilitate access to financing.\n\nProposals must connect with all available financing instruments on a European level, including relevant regional instruments. Proposals must also describe how they plan to complement the ongoing activities of bodies such as the European Innovation Council, the Circular Bioeconomy Investment Platform, and the Enterprise Europe Network.\n\nProposals must also connect with the finance platform currently being designed by BIC and to be launched by the end of 2019. The new BIC platform will aim in particular to help SMEs obtain financing for scaling up the commercialisation of bio-based technologies and products on a pilot scale.\n\nThe scope of this topic includes all start-ups and spin-offs in the bio-based sector, and is not limited to BIC members or activities, nor is it limited to spin-offs or start-ups resulting from BBI JU projects. In order to consider also actors in the primary sectors, it is recommended to foster the role of advisors and innovation brokers to support (‘speak on behalf of’) these actors during the project implementation.\n\nProposals must therefore be based on a feasible business model to create and sustain it for at least 10 years after the end of the project. The model must include estimates of costs for setting up, launching and — particularly — maintaining and updating the platform in the abovementioned period beyond the project’s runtime.\n\nParticipation is encouraged from organisations that have previously managed entrepreneurship programmes targeting start-ups and spin-offs.","increase the success rate of excellent start-ups and spin-offs;\nimprove the alignment of available financing/funding instruments with the demand of start-ups and spin-offs for financial assistance;\naccelerate the market entrance of new technologies, processes, products and applications for expanding the bio-based industry across Europe.","Start-ups and spin-offs, both young, innovative and entrepreneurial, often face big hurdles in attracting investors, or using financial instruments to help finance their business plans. They find it especially challenging in bio-based industries, as the hurdles to success are high, and investors find it more difficult to judge the associated risks. These risks are different compared with more familiar sectors like e.g. the digital sector. Entrepreneurs in the bio-based industry must cross extra hurdles to attract investors and become independent as soon as possible.\n\nOne of the ways to overcome these hurdles is by seeking out networking opportunities through suitable organisations, clusters [1] and platforms. These opportunities can bring start-ups and spin-offs into contact with large enterprises, regional clusters, open-innovation scale-up facilities, reference customers and other market actors. This will make start-ups and spin-offs more visible, allowing them to secure financing from the contacts them made.\n\nThe specific challenge is to help start-ups and spin-offs to improve their networking activities with relevant stakeholders and help to improve their business case and to gain access to funding opportunities in the bio-based sector.","","","104,682,972.32","more than 1 million","","","","https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/bbi-2020-so4-s1;freeTextSearchKeyword=;typeCodes=0,1;statusCodes=31094503;programCode=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=Default;sortQuery=submissionStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState"

From the Law Enforcement point of view, these dimensions have to be analysed in a longer term, taking into account that the potential AI benefits for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) are threefold, i.e., through: 1) proactive policing (from reactive to anticipative policing); 2) data analysis (e.g., connecting the dots, discovering criminal patterns and defragmenting LEA actions), and 3) identity checks (improving detection, targeting and interdiction).","2020-03-12","2020-08-27","17:00:00","false","Horizon 2020","European Union","EU+Associated countries","SU-AI01-2020","","Proposals under this topic should provide an EU AI roadmap for LEAs, meeting their specific operational and cooperation needs, by identifying, in a longer-term perspective: the key areas in which AI would be beneficial for LEAs, the key areas in which it could pose a threat to security, cybersecurity requirements for AI based technologies in use or to be used by LEAs as well as means of prevention and mitigation of malicious use of AI for criminal activities. As such this project would not only need to continuously interact (in a cluster mode) with projects funded under SU-AI02-2020 and SU-AI03-2020 but also provide recommendations for further work to be done under Horizon Europe, Digital Europe, or the Internal Security Fund as well as for policy and market uptake.

What are the major research gaps in the area of AI in support of LEAs? What are the challenges that need to be addressed, both from the fighting crime, including cybercrime and terrorism, and from improving cybersecurity (re)actions? Which approaches might be desirable?
